## Problem Statement

### Lead Score Case Study

An Education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals and markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google and those who are interested in the courses land on their website, browse for courses, and some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X Education is around 30% which is very poor, to make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as 'Hot Leads'. If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.

### Objective
X Education has appointed you to help them select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. You are required to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has qiven a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

### Goals of the Case Study
Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 to 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A high score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
The model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well.
